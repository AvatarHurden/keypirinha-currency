## Usage

A ```Convert Currency``` item is inserted into the catalog.
Select this item to enter conversion mode.

Enter the amount to convert, the source currency code and the destination currency code.
If either the source or destination currency are omitted, the defaults are used.
If the amount is omitted, the current exchange rate is shown.

*Currency* allows the source and destination currencies to be separated by any of the following:
 - in
 - to
 - :

To convert between multiple currencies at the same time, separate each one by a comma.
This can be done in either the source or destination field, and all combinations will be displayed in the results.
